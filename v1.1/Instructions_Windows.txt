Windows 10 instructions

Full instructions for installation found on

1. Download and install nvm from the following link
      https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.7/nvm-setup.zip

2.  Open powershell (or cmd?) and verify nvm was installed by using the command   nvm ls

3.  nvm install 12.16.2    to install the 12.16.2 version of node.js

4.  nvm use 12.16.2   to use the newly installed (requires permission confirmation)

5.  node --version  to check the version that was installed (the bot was made in consideration of version 12.16.2 which should be the latest)

6.  npm --version   to verify npm is installed 

7.   move the bot folder into C:\ root folder to prevent any folder names from leaking from the bot error messages.  It will only show something like "C:\discord_bot\bot.js Error~"

8.   use the included install_modules.bat (you can also manually install the node.js modules, open the bat file by right clicking and edit to see what modules are being installed)

9.   run the bot using
        `node bot.js`
     this window must be left open (there are tricks to make it invisible or run in background, not suggested for non-experienced users)
     the bot can be shut down by using the prefix + "--shutdown" command or through CTRL+C on the terminal/cmd/powershell that started the bot.js

10.   verify the bot is online, say "ping" in chat, it should reply with a "pong"

11.  to make the startup easier, make a shortcut of the start_bot.bat and move the shortcut to where you can easily access it.
